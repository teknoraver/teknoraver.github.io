Hi there, Internet traveler!  
Welcome to my little corner of the web.

A bit about me:

I've always been curious about how things work (thanks, [hacker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture)) and passionate about sharing what I learn (credit to the [open source community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_movement)).

That curiosity led me to start [tinkering with open-source]({{< relref "open-source.md" >}}) software years ago.
Somehow, I got so caught up in it that I didn't notice [over two decades](https://git.busybox.net/busybox/commit/?id=3443bd72863326cca2ef4ba78965c05abc77cb96) had flown by.

What started as a hobby eventually became a career. I've been lucky enough to [work at some amazing tech companies](/cv.pdf), but at the end of the day, I'm just someone who loves solving problems and learning new things.
