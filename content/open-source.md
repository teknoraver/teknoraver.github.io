## Linux kernel
I made about [140 commits to the Linux kernel](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&q=Matteo+Croce).  
I worked on different parts of the kernel, from the network stack to eBPF, with minor contributions to other subsystems like block device.  
Fun fact: my first commit is not in the kernel repository because it predates git,
which was adopted by the Linux kernel community in 2005 with kernel v2.6.12-rc2.  
To keep the history, a "history" repo holds older commits. Here is [my very first](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git/commit/?id=e0366718d27b150f33e5f8727848bd8e3e11b43f) commit on Linux.

## OpenWrt
I started [contributing to OpenWrt](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/commits?author=teknoraver) in 2007 and became a maintainer shortly after.  
I worked mostly on the AR7 platform, which was a Texas Instruments SoC used in many ADSL routers at the time.

## Snap
During my time at Canonical, I [worked on the Snap package manager](https://github.com/canonical/snapd/commits?author=teknoraver).  
This was for me the opportunity to learn Go and to work on a project that was not directly related to the Linux kernel.

## systemd
At Facebook I'm [working on systemd](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commits?author=teknoraver) upstream, developing new features and fixing bugs.

## Miscellaneous free software projects
When I find a bug or a missing feature in a project I use, I try to fix it and contribute back, however I can.
I have a lot of small changes in dozens of projects. I use [OpenHub](https://openhub.net/accounts/teknoraver/positions) to keep track of them.
